# Real-Time-Object-Detection-in-Browser
Streamlit app for real-time object detection in browser using OpenCV and yolov5 trained on custom data.

Link to deployed app: https://share.streamlit.io/mohityogesh44/real-time-object-detection-in-browser/main/main.py

Note: This model detects only a single class named Connector. Please view examples folder for sample image. The app performance might get hindered due to deployment scenarios. Please check Dev branch code and run it on local to get real performance results.

*The model has been trained on a very small(300 images) subset of actual dataset.*
